# Obsidian Website Clone

I'm learning UI development by recreating the Obsidian marketing site to understand how modern web interfaces are built.

## Why this project

I wanted to practice coding real-world UI patterns by reverse-engineering a well-designed site. Building it section by section helps me understand layout techniques, animations, and responsive design.

## Quick start

Open `index.html` in your browser.

## What's done

- Hero section
- Header navigation
- Core values
- Feature grid
- Sync tabs
- Publish features

## Notes

Learning project only. Images copyright Obsidian.
